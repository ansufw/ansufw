# Hi there! 👋 

I'm a backend engineer with a background in civil/mechanical engineering. With over 2 years of experience in the telecommunications industry, I primarily work with the Go programming language. I'm currently exploring front-end (Svelte, Qwik, etc..) and some DevOps stack such as Kubernetes.
